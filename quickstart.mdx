# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Budget System! This guide will help you get started with the basic operations.

## First Steps

1. Open your Budget spreadsheet
2. Check the budget menu items are visible
3. Check that the budget is in a state of balance by:
     - Go to **BANKS** and check the 'Books Balanced' is green and zero.
     - Go to **ANNUAL BUDGET** and check the 'Books Balanced' is green and zero.
4. If the system is not in balance, investigate and fix the issue.

## Overview of Basic Operations

1. Go to the BANKS tab and update the balances for each bank account. This is a manual process that should only take a few minutes. Go to each of the bank accounts on the internet and update the balance. Note that this will immediately send the system out of balance until the reconciliation is completed.
2. Reconcile the system.
