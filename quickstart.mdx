# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Budget System! This guide will help you get started with the basic operations.

## First Steps

1. Open your Budget spreadsheet
2. Check the budget menu items are visible
3. Check that the budget is in a state of balance by:
     - Go to **BANKS** and check the 'Books Balanced' is green and zero.
     - Go to **ANNUAL BUDGET** and check the 'Books Balanced' is green and zero.
4. If the system is not in balance, investigate and fix the issue.

## Overview of Basic Operations

### UBANK Accounts
1. Go to the both UBank account in turn (yours then mine) and do the following:
  - Go to the **BANKS** tab and update the balances for each bank account.
  - While you are in each account take note whether or not there have been any transactions since you last balanced the books.
       - If there are transactions, you will need to enter them into the system one at a time.
           - Because UBank does not allow copy and paste from their online system, you will need to download the current transactions as a PDF and then enter them manually.
           - Goto the custom menu and under 'Budget' select 'Import Bank Transactions'.
           - Select 'Manual Entry' and enter the transaction details.
           - Open up the PDF and enter the transaction details. You will be able to copy and paste the transaction details from the PDF.
  - If there are no transactions, you can skip the download.

While you are updating the balances, you can also download the current transactions for the accounts that participate in the Budget System from the bank.
  - For Ubank just choose your 'Earnings' account so we can reconcile your earnings received. You will be only allowed PDF format for the current month.
  - For the account concerned, click on your profile logo at the top right of the screen and select 'Statements' from the dropdown menu. Choose the account and download the current month's transactions. It is marked as "Interim" and is only available in PDF format.
  - For other banks, you will only need the NAB Credit Card current transactions.  It is available in CSV format (which is prefered).

2. Reconcile the system.

## End of Year Process

<Warning>
**Important Annual Process:** The End of Year (EOY) process is a critical annual procedure that must be completed in June to transition to the new fiscal year.
</Warning>

### When You Need EOY Setup
The EOY process is required when:
- **It's June** (final month of fiscal year) - System only allows access during June
- You've completed all reconciliation for the current fiscal year
- You're ready to set up the budget for the next financial year (July-June)

### EOY Process Overview
The modern EOY process is a **four-step guided workflow**:

1. **Start EOY Process** (in master spreadsheet) - Export settings and create new copy
2. **Initial Setup** (in new copy) - Configure new year and update budget amounts
3. **Continue Setup** (in new copy) - Copy balances and run final month processing
4. **Finalization** (in new copy) - Complete setup and archive previous master

### Key EOY Features
- **Month-restricted access** - Only available in June for safety
- **State-driven menus** - Menus adapt to show appropriate options for your progress
- **Automatic master archiving** - Previous year's master automatically preserved
- **Comprehensive verification** - Multiple checkpoints ensure successful setup
- **ðŸš¨ Strict balance checking** - EOY process is blocked if system is not in perfect balance

### Critical Balance Requirement
<Warning>
**New in 2024:** The EOY process now **strictly enforces** balance checking. If any balance sheet is not at zero, the process will be completely blocked with no override option.

**Why:** EOY copies bank balances to become opening balances for the new year. Wrong balances would corrupt your entire new fiscal year.

**Solution:**
1. **First** - Update ALL bank balances to be accurate as at June 30 (banks often apply monthly interest as final transaction)
2. **Second** - Use 'Reconciliation Dashboard' to resolve any Cash Flow transaction issues (missing, extra, or unreconciled transactions)
</Warning>

<Note>
The EOY process includes automatic archiving of your previous master spreadsheet, so you don't need to manually manage historical copies. The system handles this for you during finalization.
