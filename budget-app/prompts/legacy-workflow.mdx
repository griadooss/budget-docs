## Steps:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building-columns" title="Update bank balances">
    - First of all update all banking accounts. Use the check box to keep track of the accounts you have processed. 
    - This has to be done manually by visiting each account in turn and manually transferring the account balance to the spreadsheet as appropriate. 
    - Be sure to also update the current Cash on Hand at the same time.

    NB: In doing so the "Books Balanced" control will now indicate that the books are out of balance. This will persist until the reconcilliation process has been completed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="wallet" title="Update the Cash Flow tab">
   - Enter the transactions you have made from source documents, such as receipts. 
   - It is imperative that every time expenditure is made that receipts are collected, as it is unlikely you will remember all the times you have exchange cash for goods. This will prevent the budgeting system from being reconciled.
   - Use the receipts to enter all cash transactions (including purchases by credit and/or debit card). 
   - Where receipts from a single establishment contains items from mixied categories, split the total expense into separate lines and use the SPLIT column to sum all the categories to equal the total on the receipt. 
   This is the value that will be reconcilled against the bank records/statement.  
   </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="folder" title="Import Bank transactions">
   - Log into each bank from which transactions have been made since the last reconcilliation and download the current transaction list. 
   - Choose the CSV format and a range of dates that overlaps the last reconcilled date by a day or two.
   - Open the CSV file in a spreadsheet application. 
   - Find the last reconcilliation date from the NAB_TRNX tab and use that date to highlight all the transactions in the openend CSV file from that date on.

   - Copy the block of lines and paste [Paste special > Values only (CTRL+SHIFT+V)] them into the NAB_TRNX tab of the budget spreadsheet, appending them to the end of the current list of bank transactions, 
   leaving a few lines between the reconcilled list and the newly imported lines.

    - Highling the columns to be removed .. the data that is not necessary for the reconcilliation process   
   
   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_04.png"
/>
   - Remove the approapirate cells of the pasted data so that the information remaining lines up with the existing columns of bank data in the list, which should be:

   |    Date   | Amount | CheckBox |     Merchant Name    | 
   | :-------: | :-----:| -------- | :------------------: |
   | 26 Jan 25 |   -80  |          |         Mate.        |
   
   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_05.png"
/>

  - Now sort the just pasted data by date, so that the earliest date is at the top of the newly pasted list.

   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_06.png"
/>
  
  - Next, click on the cell containing the template to remove the minus sign that was inherited by the amounts copied and pasted from the bank statement. (in this case C446). 
  Click on it and select the small box now in the lower right had corner of the cell and drag the cell containing the ZERO all the way to the cell AFTER the last cell in the pasted list.
  You will note that this action populates all the empty cells in this column with the +ve value of the expense amounts.

  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_07.png"
/>
  - While the column of now positive values is highlighted, copy it and paste [Paste special > Values only (CTRL+SHIFT+V)] the coloumn to over-write the column of negative values adjacent to the left. 
  - Now UN-check the very last checked box, C438, and drag that empty check box all the way down to the cell just above the cell with the ZERO in it, filling the column with empty check-boxes.
  - Re-Check the cell at the top of the column of empty check boxes .. the one that you previously unchecked.
  
   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_08.png"
/>

  - Next, using the check-box, mark all the just pasted rows that already exist above in the previously reconciled rows of transactions.

   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_09.png"
/>

  - and delete those checked rows in the newly pasted rows copied from the bank statement.

   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_10
  .png"
/>

  - Now highlight the complete block of newly imported data from the bank statement (INCLUDING: the very bottom cell containing the ZERO) and move the whole block up to the botton of the existing list of bank transactioins.
  - Finally, use the 'Paint format' menu item to copy the existing row formatting to the new rows.

   </Accordion>
   <Accordion icon="laptop-code" title="Reconcile the Cash Flow with the Bank Statement">
   To reconcile the expenses in the budgeting system, it is now just a matter of comparing the un-checked rows between the Cash Flow tab and the NAB_TRNX tab.
   - Go to the Cash Flow tab and take the first unchecked item ... in this case the split item from ALDI for 119.03
   
   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_12.png"
/>

  - and reconcile it against the NAB_TRNX tab by checking the check-box on both tabs ... the Cash Flow tab and the NAB_TRNX tab.

   <img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/NAB_TRNX_13.png"
/>

  - Continue with this process untill all lines on both tabs have been matched.
  - If you now look at the BANKS tab, you should find that the 'BOOKS BALANCED' cell has turned green with ZERO balance being shown.
  - If this is not the case, one of two things could be the cause:
  > 1. Not all the necessary expended items from the Bank Statement have been imported to the NAB_TRNX tab.
  > 2. Not all the cash flow items have been input from receipts at the beginning of the reconcilliation process.
  
  and there is a third item that might be causing the mis-reconcilliation.

  > 3. There has been INCOME during the period, the receipt of which has affected the Bank Balances, in a positive manner. 
   - Check for incoming credits to the bank accounts and include them as INC in the Cash Flow tab.
   - Continue this process until the control cell on the BANKS tab turns green and indicated ZERO BALANCE.
   - Finally, return to the Cash Flow tab and use 'Paint format' to copy the format from previously reconcilled expense to that all the newly reconcilled items have been colour coded as reconciled also.
