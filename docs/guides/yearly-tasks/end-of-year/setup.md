# EOY Budget Setup

This guide provides simple, direct instructions for completing the End of Year (EOY) process to set up your new fiscal year budget.

<Warning>
**Timing:** The EOY process can only be started during June (the final month of the fiscal year). The system will block access during other months.
</Warning>

## Before You Start

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites (Must Complete First)

1. **Current month must be June** - System automatically checks this
2. **All balances must be zero:**
   - **Banks sheet:** Cell C30 = $0.00
   - **Annual Budget sheet:** Cell B106 = $0.00
   - **Maintain Budget sheet:** Cell E120 = $0.00

<Warning>
**Critical:** If any balance is not zero, the EOY process will be blocked. Fix balance issues using the Reconciliation Dashboard before starting EOY.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Start EOY Process (Master Spreadsheet)

### 1.1 Export Properties
1. In your **master spreadsheet** (June only)
2. Go to **Period Processing** ‚Üí **Start End of Year Process**
3. Click **Export Properties Now** when prompted
4. Wait for success confirmation

### 1.2 Create New Copy
1. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Make a copy**
2. Name it "Budget-2025" (or your new year)
3. Choose destination folder
4. Click **Make a copy**
5. **Open the new copy**

## Step 2: Initial Setup (New Copy)

### 2.1 Run Initial Setup
1. In the **new copy**, go to **Period Processing** ‚Üí **1. Run Initial EOY Setup**
2. **Complete authorization** when prompted (Google warnings are normal and safe)
3. Click **YES** to proceed with setup

### 2.1a Authorization Process (Important!)

When you run the initial setup, Google will ask you to authorize the scripts. **Don't worry - this is normal and safe!**

**What you'll see:**

1. **"Authorization Required" dialog appears**
   - Click **"Continue"** to proceed

2. **Google Account Selection**
   - Select your Google account (the same one you use for Google Sheets)

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Scary-looking Security Warning** (This is normal!)
   - You'll see: **"Google hasn't verified this app"**
   - You'll see: **"The app is requesting access to sensitive info"**
   - **Don't panic!** This is Google's standard warning for ALL custom spreadsheet scripts

4. **Continue Despite Warning:**
   - Click **"Advanced"** (bottom left of the dialog)
   - Click **"Go to Budget App Scripts (unsafe)"** - *this is safe, just Google's standard warning*
   - **Check "Select all"** checkbox to grant required permissions
   - Click **"Continue"**

5. **Success Confirmation**
   - You'll see a success message
   - The setup process will continue automatically

<Warning>
**About the "Unsafe" Warning:** Google shows this warning for ALL custom spreadsheet scripts, not because there's actually a problem. The budget system is safe to authorize - it only accesses your budget spreadsheet data and nothing else.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If authorization fails, refresh the page and try again. The system includes retry logic for common authorization issues.
