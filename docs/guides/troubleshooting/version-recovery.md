## 🎓 Understanding the System

### What Are Properties?

**Properties** are settings that control how your budget works:

- Current month
- Month statuses
- System configuration

**Why they matter:** If properties don't match your spreadsheet, the system breaks.

**How we fix it:** We store snapshots of properties and restore them when needed.

---

### What Is a Snapshot?

A **snapshot** is a copy of your properties at a specific time.

**When snapshots are created:**

- Before End of Month (EOM) processing
- After End of Month (EOM) processing

**Why they're important:** They let us restore properties to match your restored spreadsheet.

---

### What Is Version History?

**Version History** is Google Sheets' built-in feature that saves copies of your spreadsheet over time.

**What it saves:**

- ✅ Spreadsheet data
- ✅ Formulas
- ✅ Structure

**What it doesn't save:**

- ❌ Properties (we handle this separately)

**Why we need both:** To restore everything correctly, we need both the spreadsheet version AND the matching properties.
