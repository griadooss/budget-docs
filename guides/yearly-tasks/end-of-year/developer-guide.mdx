# EOY Process Developer Guide

This guide contains technical information for developers who are maintaining or enhancing the End of Year (EOY) process. End users should refer to the [End of Year Process Overview](/guides/yearly-tasks/end-of-year/overview) and [EOY Budget Setup](/guides/yearly-tasks/end-of-year/setup) guides instead.

## Development and Testing Workflow

When developing and testing the EOY process, follow these steps to ensure you're always testing with the latest code:

### During Development

1. Make script changes to the MASTER spreadsheet
2. Push changes using `clasp push` to update MASTER's scripts
3. Delete any existing test copies of the spreadsheet
4. Make a fresh copy of MASTER for testing
5. Test the EOY process in the new copy
6. Repeat steps 1-5 as needed during development

### Important Notes

- Always delete old test copies before making a new one
- Each copy gets its own Apps Script project
- Using old copies may test outdated code
- Fresh copies ensure you're testing the latest changes

### Testing Checklist

1. Before testing:

   - Ensure all changes are pushed to MASTER
   - Delete any existing test copies
   - Make a fresh copy

2. During testing:

   - Use the fresh copy
   - Document any issues found
   - Note any needed script changes

3. After finding issues:
   - Make fixes in MASTER
   - Push changes to MASTER
   - Delete test copy
   - Make new copy for next round of testing

## Code Structure

The EOY process is implemented in the `yearEndBudget.js` file and includes several key functions:

- `setupNewYearBudget()` - Main entry point for the EOY process
- `showManualBudgetInstructions()` - Displays the instructions dialog
- `continueEOYSetup()` - Handles the second phase of the EOY process
- `finalizeEOYSetup()` - Completes the EOY process
- `archiveLegacyMaster()` - Archives the old master spreadsheet
- `testArchiveMaster()` - Test function for the archiving process

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Property Management**

   - Properties are exported from the original spreadsheet and imported into the new copy
   - The `exportPropertiesToSheet()` and `importPropertiesFromSheet()` functions handle this

2. **Sheet Verification**

   - The `verifyBudgetSetup()` function checks that all required sheets and named ranges exist

3. **Date Handling**

   - The EOY process is sensitive to date formats and timezones
   - Australian date format (dd/mm/yyyy) is used throughout
   - The fiscal year runs from July to June

4. **Month Status Tracking**
   - The `MONTH_STATUSES` property tracks which month is current
   - The `initializeMonthStatuses()` function sets up the initial state

## Legacy Master Archiving

The EOY process now includes automatic archiving of the previous master spreadsheet once the new spreadsheet is fully set up. This section explains the technical implementation and limitations.

### Implementation Details

1. **Process Flow**

   - During `finalizeEOYSetup()`, the system first stores the current master ID: `VersionControl.getCurrentSpreadsheetId()`
   - It saves this ID as a script property: `PREVIOUS_MASTER_ID`
   - After marking the new spreadsheet as master, it calls `archiveLegacyMaster()` with the stored ID

2. **Archiving Function**

   - `archiveLegacyMaster(spreadsheetId, testMode)` handles the archiving process
   - It opens the specified spreadsheet using `SpreadsheetApp.openById()`
   - It determines the fiscal year using `getFiscalYearFromSpreadsheet()`
   - It renames the spreadsheet to include "\_ARCHIVED_FY{year}"
   - It creates a hidden "\_Archive" sheet with metadata

3. **Test Mode**
   - The function includes a test mode parameter that creates a copy instead of modifying the original
   - Test mode is useful for verifying the archiving logic without affecting production spreadsheets
   - Use `testArchiveMaster()` to safely test the archiving process

### Technical Limitations

1. **Script Properties**

   - Due to Google Apps Script's security model, you cannot directly modify script properties of another spreadsheet
   - This means the archived spreadsheet will still have `IS_MASTER = true` in its script properties
   - To users, the archived spreadsheet might still appear to be a master

2. **Potential Solutions**

   - Creating a standalone web app that runs in the context of the archived spreadsheet
   - Using the Sheets API instead of SpreadsheetApp (requires additional permissions)
   - Instructing users to not use the archived spreadsheet for active budgeting

3. **Current Implementation**
   - We use a hidden sheet with metadata as the primary marker of archived status
   - We include clear documentation for users about this limitation
   - The renamed spreadsheet title provides a visual indicator that it's archived

### Testing the Archiving Feature

To test the archiving feature without affecting production data:

1. Open the script editor in your spreadsheet
2. Run the `testArchiveMaster()` function
3. When prompted, leave the spreadsheet ID blank to use the current spreadsheet
4. This will create a test copy with "\_ARCHIVED_TEST" suffix
5. Examine the test copy to confirm it has the hidden "\_Archive" sheet with metadata

This approach allows safe testing of the archiving mechanism without renaming or modifying your original spreadsheet.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the EOY process that could be implemented in the future:

1. **Automated Pre-EOY Checks**

   - Verify all accounts are reconciled
   - Check that sheets are balanced
   - Ensure all budget items are properly distributed

2. **Improved Script Property Handling**

   - Develop a method to modify script properties in the archived spreadsheet
   - Research potential API-based solutions

3. **Enhanced User Guidance**
   - Step-by-step wizard interface for the EOY process
   - Progress tracking across multiple sessions
   - More detailed error messages and recovery options
