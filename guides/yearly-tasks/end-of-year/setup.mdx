# EOY Budget Setup

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for the End of Year (EOY) budget process. The current implementation uses a streamlined **three-step approach** with intelligent menu progression and automated verification.

<Warning>
**Month Restriction:** The EOY process can only be initiated during June (the final month of the fiscal year). The system will block access during other months.
</Warning>

## Pre-Setup Verification

Before starting the EOY process, ensure these requirements are met:

### 1. **Timing Requirements**
- **Current month must be June** - System automatically validates
- All monthly reconciliation should be complete through May
- Ready to transition to the new fiscal year (July 1st start)

### 2. **Account Reconciliation**
- **LastReconciliationDate** should be at or near June 30
- All bank transactions properly categorized and reconciled
- No unresolved discrepancies in account balances

### 3. **Balanced Sheets** (Critical - Strictly Enforced)
- **Banks sheet:** Cell C30 = $0.00 (zero balance)
- **Annual Budget sheet:** Cell B106 = $0.00 (balanced budget)
- **Maintain Budget sheet:** Cell E120 = $0.00 (balanced maintenance)

<Warning>
**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The system **strictly enforces** balance checking and will **completely block** the EOY process if any sheet is unbalanced.

**Why No Override:** The EOY process copies current bank balances to become opening balances for the new fiscal year. Incorrect balances would corrupt your entire new year's foundation data.

**Error Message:** You'll see "Balance Check Failed - EOY Process Blocked" with no proceed option.

**Solution:**
1. **First** - Update ALL bank balances to be accurate as at June 30 (banks often apply monthly interest as final transaction)
2. **Second** - Use 'Reconciliation Dashboard' to resolve any Cash Flow transaction issues (missing, extra, or unreconciled transactions)
</Warning>



## Step 1: Initial Setup (Master Spreadsheet)

### Starting the Process

1. **Navigate to Period Processing Menu**
   - In your master spreadsheet (June only)
   - Click **Period Processing** â†’ **Start End of Year Process**

2. **Review the Help Dialog**
   - Read the overview of the EOY process
   - Click **View Full Documentation** to access this guide
   - Click **Export Properties Now** to continue

### Property Export (Critical Step)

The system will automatically export your current settings to a hidden sheet:

1. **Automatic Export Process**
   - Script properties saved to hidden sheet
   - Configuration settings preserved
   - Named ranges and critical data exported
   - Success confirmation displayed

2. **What Gets Exported**
   - IS_MASTER status and spreadsheet identifiers
   - Month status tracking and current period
   - Reconciliation dates and settings
   - Custom configuration values

<Tip>
**Why Property Export Matters:** This ensures all your current settings transfer correctly to the new spreadsheet copy, maintaining continuity in your budget system.
</Tip>

### Creating the New Copy

After property export is complete:

1. **Create Spreadsheet Copy**
   - Go to **File** â†’ **Make a copy**
   - Name: "Budget-YYYY" (e.g., "Budget-2025")
   - Choose destination folder
   - Click **Make a copy**

2. **Open the New Copy**
   - Open the newly created spreadsheet
   - Note: The menu will show only EOY setup options
   - Ready to proceed with Step 2

## Step 2: Configuration & Setup (New Copy)

### 2A: Run Initial EOY Setup

1. **Access EOY Setup Menu**
   - In the new copy, go to **Period Processing**
   - Click **1. Run Initial EOY Setup**
   - The menu shows only EOY options at this stage

2. **Script Authorization** (if required)
   - Click **Continue** when prompted
   - Select your Google account
   - **Important:** Google will show a scary-looking warning - this is normal!
   - You'll see "Google hasn't verified this app" and "requesting access to sensitive info"
   - Click **"Advanced"** (bottom left corner)
   - Click **"Go to Budget App Scripts (unsafe)"** - *this is actually safe, just Google's standard warning*
   - **Check "Select all"** checkbox to grant all required permissions
   - Click **"Allow"**

<Warning>
**Don't Be Alarmed by Google's Warning:** The "unsafe" and "not verified" messages are Google's standard warnings for ALL custom spreadsheet scripts. Your budget system is safe - it only accesses your spreadsheet data and performs budget operations. Google requires this warning for any script that isn't published in their official store.
</Warning>

### 2B: Automated Verification

The system automatically runs comprehensive verification checks:

1. **Sheet Structure Validation**
   - Verifies all required sheets exist
   - Checks named ranges configuration
   - Validates formula integrity

2. **System Configuration**
   - Confirms timezone settings
   - Verifies budget formula structure
   - Checks data integrity

3. **Results Handling**
   - **Success:** Proceed to configuration dialog
   - **Failure:** Fix reported issues and retry

### 2C: New Year Configuration

   - **Budget Start Date:** Verify July 1st of new fiscal year
   - **Weekly Shopping Day:** Set your preferred day
   - **Payment Schedules:** Configure pay dates and pension days
   - **Other Settings:** Review and adjust as needed

2. **Save Configuration**
   - Click **Save** to apply settings
   - System imports previous year's settings where applicable
   - Configuration automatically activates the Maintain Budget sheet

### 2D: Manual Budget Update

After saving configuration, the system automatically:

1. **Displays Budget Setup Instructions**

   - Instructions remain accessible in this documentation

2. **Activates Maintain Budget Sheet**
   - Automatically switches to the correct sheet
   - Scrolls to the income section
   - Ready for budget review and updates

#### Income Budget Review

In the **INCOME BUDGET** section:

1. **Review Previous Year Performance**
   - Column D shows last year's actual amounts
   - Compare against previous budget amounts
   - Identify trends and changes needed

2. **Update Budget Amounts**
   - Column E: Update budget amounts for new year

3. **Income Considerations**
   - Include salary increases or changes
   - Add new income sources if applicable
   - Remove discontinued income streams

#### Expense Budget Review

In the **EXPENSE BUDGET** section:

1. **Review Expense Categories**
   - Column D shows last year's actual spending
   - Identify over/under budget categories
   - Plan adjustments for new year

2. **Update Expense Budgets**
   - Column E: Update budget amounts
   - Column F: Adjust payment frequencies
   - Column I: Distribution flag (auto-resets when changed)

3. **Budget Balancing**
   - Monitor **Cell E120** (BUDGET BALANCED)
   - Adjust amounts until this cell shows $0.00
   - Ensures income equals expenses

#### Finalize Budget Changes

1. **Click REFRESH Button**
   - Located at bottom of configuration section
   - Recalculates monthly distributions
   - Updates Annual Budget sheet formulas

2. **Verify Balance**
   - Confirm Cell E120 shows $0.00
   - All income distributed correctly
   - All expense categories properly budgeted

### 2E: Continue EOY Setup

After completing the manual budget update:

1. **Access Continue Menu**
   - Navigate to **Period Processing** â†’ **2. Continue EOY Setup**
   - System will verify budget balance before proceeding

2. **Budget Balance Check**
   - Must show $0.00 in Cell E120
   - If not balanced, return to budget updates
   - Only proceed when fully balanced

3. **Automated Processing**
   The system automatically:
   - **Copies bank balances** to opening positions for new year
   - **Updates monthly headers** across all sheets to new fiscal year
   - **Clears transaction sheets** (Cash Flow and Bank Records)
   - **Preserves structure** while removing old transaction data

4. **Completion Confirmation**
   - Success message displayed
   - Annual Budget sheet activated to show changes
   - Ready for Step 3 (Finalization)

### 2F: Run End of Month Processing

After completing the Continue EOY Setup, you must run the End of Month process for the final month of the fiscal year:

1. **Access End of Month Menu**
   - Navigate to **Period Processing** â†’ **Run End of Month Process**
   - This finalizes all transactions for the current fiscal year

2. **End of Month Processing**
   - System processes the final month (June) transactions
   - Completes reconciliation for the fiscal year
   - Prepares the system for finalization

3. **Verification**
   - Ensure the End of Month process completes successfully
   - Check that all balances are correct
   - Only proceed to Step 3 after successful completion

<Note>
**Why This Step is Required:** The End of Month process for June (the final fiscal month) must be completed before you can finalize the EOY setup. This ensures all fiscal year data is properly processed and balanced.
</Note>

## Step 3: Finalization (New Copy)

### 3A: Pre-Finalization Verification

1. **Access Finalization Menu**
   - Navigate to **Period Processing** â†’ **3. Finalize EOY Setup**
   - System runs comprehensive completion checks

2. **Automated Verification**
   The system verifies:
   - **Banks sheet balance** (Cell C30 = $0.00)
   - **Annual Budget balance** (Cell B106 = $0.00)
   - **Maintain Budget balance** (Cell E120 = $0.00)
   - **Distribution flags** properly set in Column I

3. **Verification Results**
   - **All checks pass:** Proceed to finalization
   - **Issues found:** Fix reported problems and retry

### 3B: Complete Finalization

1. **Final Confirmation**
   - Click **YES** to finalize the EOY setup
   - This action cannot be undone
   - Marks this spreadsheet as the new master

2. **Automated Master Setup**
   The system automatically:
   - **Initializes month statuses** for the new fiscal year
   - **Sets IS_MASTER = true** in the new spreadsheet
   - **Archives the previous master** (automatic process)

### 3C: Legacy Master Archiving

**Automatic Archiving Process:**

1. **Previous Master Renamed**
   - Automatically gets "\_ARCHIVED_FY{year}" suffix
   - Example: "Budget_MASTER_ARCHIVED_FY2024"
   - No manual action required

2. **Archive Metadata Added**
   - Hidden "\_Archive" sheet created with:
     - Archival date and timestamp
     - Former master indicator
     - New master spreadsheet ID

3. **Clear Separation**
   - New copy becomes active master
   - Archived master preserved for history
   - No confusion about which to use

<Warning>
**Technical Limitation:** Due to Google Apps Script security restrictions, the archived spreadsheet may still show script properties indicating it's a master. However, the renamed title and archive metadata clearly mark it as archived. Always use the new master for active budgeting.
</Warning>

## Post-EOY Verification

After completing all three steps:

### 1. **Test Core Functions**
- Verify monthly processing works correctly
- Test transaction import functionality
- Confirm reconciliation dashboard operates properly

### 2. **Menu System Check**
- Period Processing menu should show normal options:
  - **Run End of Month Process**
  - **Start End of Year Process** (for next year)
- All EOY setup options should be hidden

### 3. **Historical Data**
- Keep archived master for historical reference
- All previous fiscal year data remains accessible
- New master ready for new fiscal year operations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authorization Problems
- **Solution:** Refresh browser and retry authorization
- **Persistent issues:** Check account permissions and browser settings

### Budget Won't Balance
- **Check:** All income and expense amounts entered correctly
- **Verify:** Frequencies set properly (12 for monthly, 1 for annual)
- **Review:** Look for missing categories or calculation errors

### Bank Balances Not Copying
- **Verify:** Banks sheet structure is correct
- **Check:** Current balances are accurate before EOY start
- **Ensure:** Bank account names haven't changed

### Verification Failures
- **Sheet Issues:** Ensure all required sheets exist and are properly named
- **Named Ranges:** Verify named ranges are configured correctly
- **Formulas:** Check for any formula errors in budget sheets

### Archived Master Concerns
- **Title Change:** Archived master should have "\_ARCHIVED_FY{year}" suffix
- **Archive Sheet:** Look for hidden "\_Archive" sheet with metadata
- **Usage:** Always use the new master, not the archived version

## Next Steps

After successful EOY completion:

1. **Begin New Fiscal Year Operations**
   - Import first transactions of new year
   - Start monthly reconciliation process
   - Monitor budget performance against new targets

2. **Historical Reference**
   - Keep archived master accessible for historical data
   - Reference previous year's actuals for future planning
   - Maintain backup copies for important financial records

<Note>
The EOY process is designed to be completed in one session, but you can pause between steps if needed. The state-driven menu system ensures you can always pick up where you left off.
