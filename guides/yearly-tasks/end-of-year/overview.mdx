# End of Year Process Overview

The End of Year (EOY) process helps you transition from one financial year to the next while maintaining your budget history and setting up a fresh budget for the new year.

## When to Use

The EOY process should be initiated when:

- You're approaching the end of your financial year (June 30th)
- All transactions for the current year have been reconciled
- You're ready to start planning for the next financial year

## Process Summary

The EOY process consists of several key steps:

1. **Preparation**

   - Verify final month reconciliation
   - Check budget setup
   - Ensure all required data is in place

2. **Create New Budget**

   - Create a copy of your current budget
   - Set up the new financial year
   - Configure new year settings

3. **Manual Budget Update**

   - Update budget categories
   - Set new year budget amounts
   - Balance your budget

4. **Finalization**
   - Copy bank balances
   - Clear transaction sheets
   - Register as the new master

## Pre-EOY Checks

Before beginning the EOY process, ensure:

1. **All accounts are reconciled**

   - The LastReconciliationDate should be at or near the end of the financial year (June 30)
   - All transactions should be properly categorized and reconciled

2. **Balanced sheets**
   - Banks sheet should have a zero balance in cell C30
   - Annual Budget sheet should have a zero balance in cell B106
   - Maintain Budget sheet should have a zero balance in cell E120
