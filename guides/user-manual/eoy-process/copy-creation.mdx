# Creating Your New Budget Copy

The first step in the End of Year (EOY) process is creating a copy of your current budget spreadsheet. This copy will become your new budget for the next financial year.

## Accessing the EOY Process

1. Open your current budget spreadsheet
2. Navigate to the "Period Processing" menu
3. Click "End of Year Process"
4. Review the help dialog instructions

## Creating the Copy

### Step 1: Make a Copy

1. In your current budget spreadsheet:
   - Click "File" in the menu bar
   - Select "Make a copy"
   - The "Copy document" dialog will appear

### Step 2: Name the Copy

1. In the "Copy document" dialog:
   - Enter the new name as "Budget-YYYY" (e.g., "Budget-2025")
   - This naming convention helps identify the budget year

### Step 3: Choose Location

1. Select where to save the copy:
   - Choose an appropriate folder in your Google Drive
   - Consider creating a dedicated "Budget" folder if you haven't already

### Step 4: Configure Sharing

1. Review sharing settings:
   - Ensure appropriate access levels are maintained
   - Update sharing permissions if needed

## Authorizing the New Copy

After creating your copy, you'll need to authorize the budget scripts:

1. When you first try to use any menu item, you'll see an "Authorization Required" dialog
2. Click "OK" to proceed with authorization
3. Select your Google account
4. You will see a security warning "Google hasn't verified this app"
   - This warning appears because the budget app is currently unverified
   - The app is requesting access to your Google Account
   - You will see the developer email (johneamer48@gmail.com)
5. To proceed, click "Advanced" at the bottom left
6. Click "Go to Budget System (unsafe)"
   - While marked "unsafe", this is your own copy of the budget spreadsheet
   - The warning appears because the app isn't verified by Google yet
7. Review the permissions and click "Allow"
8. Wait for the authorization process to complete
9. The spreadsheet will refresh

### Important: Starting the EOY Setup

In the new copy, to start the EOY setup process:

1. Click "Period Processing > End of Year Process"
2. Instead of showing the help dialog, this will now start the actual EOY setup process
3. Follow the configuration wizard to set up your new budget

Note: While the menu item shows the same text in both the original and copy, its behavior is different:

- In the original spreadsheet: Shows help instructions for creating a copy
- In the new copy: Starts the EOY setup process

### Security Information

- The app runs entirely within your Google Sheets environment
- All data stays within your Google Account
- No data is sent to external servers
- You can review the app's code in the Script Editor (Tools > Script editor)

## Important Considerations

### Before Creating the Copy

- Ensure all current year data is complete
- Verify you have sufficient Google Drive space
- Check that you have permission to create copies

### After Creating the Copy

- Don't delete any sheets in the new copy
- Keep the original spreadsheet for historical records
- Complete the authorization process before proceeding
- Test all menu functions in the new copy

## Next Steps

After creating and authorizing your copy:

1. Open the new copy
2. Run "Period Processing > Verify Setup"
3. Check all categories and accounts
4. Update annual budget amounts

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify you have sufficient permissions
2. Check your Google Drive space
3. Ensure all required sheets are present
4. If authorization fails, try:
   - Refreshing the page
   - Clearing browser cache
   - Using an incognito/private window
5. Contact support if needed
