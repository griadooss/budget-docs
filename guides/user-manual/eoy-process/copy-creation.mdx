# Creating Your New Budget Copy

The first step in the End of Year (EOY) process is creating a copy of your current budget spreadsheet. This copy will become your new budget for the next financial year.

## Accessing the EOY Process

1. Open your current budget spreadsheet
2. Navigate to the "Period Processing" menu
3. Click "End of Year Process"
4. Review the help dialog instructions

## Creating the Copy

### Step 1: Make a Copy

1. In your current budget spreadsheet:
   - Click "File" in the menu bar
   - Select "Make a copy"
   - The "Copy document" dialog will appear

### Step 2: Name the Copy

1. In the "Copy document" dialog:
   - Enter the new name as "Budget-YYYY" (e.g., "Budget-2025")
   - This naming convention helps identify the budget year

### Step 3: Choose Location

1. Select where to save the copy:
   - Choose an appropriate folder in your Google Drive
   - Consider creating a dedicated "Budget" folder if you haven't already

### Step 4: Configure Sharing

1. Review sharing settings:
   - Ensure appropriate access levels are maintained
   - Update sharing permissions if needed

## Important Considerations

### Before Creating the Copy

- Ensure all current year data is complete
- Verify you have sufficient Google Drive space
- Check that you have permission to create copies

### After Creating the Copy

- Don't delete any sheets in the new copy
- Keep the original spreadsheet for historical records
- Test all menu functions in the new copy

## Next Steps

After creating your copy:

1. Open the new copy
2. Run "Period Processing > Verify Setup"
3. Check all categories and accounts
4. Update annual budget amounts
