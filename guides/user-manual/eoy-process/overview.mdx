# End of Year Process Overview

The End of Year (EOY) process helps you transition from one financial year to the next while maintaining your budget history and setting up a fresh budget for the new year.

## When to Use

The EOY process should be initiated when:

- You're approaching the end of your financial year (June 30th)
- All transactions for the current year have been reconciled
- You're ready to start planning for the next financial year

## Process Overview

The EOY process consists of several key steps:

1. **Preparation**

   - Verify final month reconciliation
   - Check budget setup
   - Ensure all required data is in place

2. **Create New Budget**

   - Create a copy of your current budget
   - Set up the new financial year
   - Configure new year settings

3. **Setup and Verification**

   - Update budget categories
   - Set new year budget amounts
   - Verify all configurations

4. **Finalization**
   - Archive the previous year's budget
   - Complete the transition to the new year

## Accessing the Process

The EOY process menu item behaves differently depending on whether you're in the original spreadsheet or a copy:

### In Original Spreadsheet

1. Navigate to the "Period Processing" menu
2. Click "End of Year Process"
3. Follow the instructions in the help dialog to create a copy

### In New Copy

1. Navigate to the "Period Processing" menu
2. Click "Run End of Year Setup"
3. Follow the setup wizard to configure your new budget

## Important Notes

- Keep your original budget spreadsheet for historical records
- Don't delete any sheets in the new copy
- Test all menu functions after setup
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to create spreadsheet copies
- You must authorize the script in the new copy before proceeding

## Authorization Process

When you first open menu items in the new copy:

1. You'll see an "Authorization Required" dialog
2. Click "OK" to proceed
3. Select your Google account
4. Review the permissions
5. Click "Allow" to grant access
6. Wait for the authorization to complete

## Next Steps

After viewing the help dialog:

1. Create a new copy of your budget
2. Authorize the scripts in the new copy
3. Run the EOY setup process
4. Complete the configuration
5. Verify the setup

## Development and Testing Workflow

When developing and testing the EOY process, follow these steps to ensure you're always testing with the latest code:

### During Development

1. Make script changes to the MASTER spreadsheet
2. Push changes using `clasp push` to update MASTER's scripts
3. Delete any existing test copies of the spreadsheet
4. Make a fresh copy of MASTER for testing
5. Test the EOY process in the new copy
6. Repeat steps 1-5 as needed during development

### Important Notes

- Always delete old test copies before making a new one
- Each copy gets its own Apps Script project
- Using old copies may test outdated code
- Fresh copies ensure you're testing the latest changes

### Testing Checklist

1. Before testing:

   - Ensure all changes are pushed to MASTER
   - Delete any existing test copies
   - Make a fresh copy

2. During testing:

   - Use the fresh copy
   - Document any issues found
   - Note any needed script changes

3. After finding issues:
   - Make fixes in MASTER
   - Push changes to MASTER
   - Delete test copy
   - Make new copy for next round of testing
